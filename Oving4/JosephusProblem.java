/**
 * Josephus problem is a math puzzle with a grim description: n prisoners are standing on a circle, sequentially numbered from 0 to nâˆ’1.
 * An executioner walks along the circle, starting from prisoner 0, removing every k-th prisoner and killing him.
 * As the process goes on, the circle becomes smaller and smaller, until only one prisoner remains, who is then freed.
 * Given any n and k, find out which prisoner will be the last one alive in the end.
